Abstract
--------

This is a simple terminal multiplexing utility for Node.js
environments. It is inspired by the awesome and unreachable
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) native Unix utility. It is
intended to provide just a very tiny subset of the original
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) functionality, but in a portable way for
bare Node.js environments. It's only nasty dependency is the essential
native Node.js module [node-pty](https://github.com/Tyriar/node-pty). As
a consequence, this utility can be installed via just NPM and without
any surrounding Unix-like environments (like Cygwin or MinGW under
Windows, MacPorts or Homebrew under macOS, etc), which the original
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) would require.

Example
-------

The following command...

```
$ stmux -w -- [ [ bash .. vim ] : mc ]
```

...leads to the following particular terminal multiplexing environment,
where GNU bash, Vim and Midnight Commander are running side-by-side
inside their own XTerm emulating terminal widget:

Intention
---------

This utility is primarily intended to be used from within a
`package.json` `script` to easily side-by-side run various
NPM-based commands in a Node.js build-time environment. For
more sophisticated use-cases please stick with the original
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/), of course.

Sample `package.json` entries from a top-level NPM-based project
follows, which allows one to run the commands of two sub-projects.
First, the build-time of the user interface (frontend) project.
Second, the build-time of the server (backend) project.
Third, the run-time of the server (backed) project.
Forth, an additional regular shell.

```
{
    ...
    "devDependencies": {
        "stmux": "*"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "dev":      "stmux -- [ [ 'npm run build:ui' .. 'npm run build:sv' ] : [ 'npm start' .. $SHELL ] ]",
        "build:ui": "cd ui && npm build:watch",
        "build:sv": "cd sv && npm build:watch",
        "start":    "cd sv && npm start"
    }
}
```

Installation
------------

```
$ npm install -g stmux
```

Usage
-----

The following command line arguments are supported:

```
$ stmux [-h] [-V] [-w] [-a <activator>] [-t <title>] [-f <file>] [-- <spec>]
```

- `-h`, `--help`<br/>
  Show usage help.
- `-V`, `--version`<br/>
  Show program version information.
- `-w`, `--wait`<br/>
  Wait after last finished command and do not shutdown automatically.
- `-a <activator>`, `--activator <activator>`<br/>
  Use `CTRL+<activator>` as the prefix to special commands.
  The default activator character is `a`.
- `-t <title>`, `--title <title>`<br/>
  Set title on terminal. The default title is `stmux`.
- `-f <file>`, `--file <file>`<br/>
  Read specification `<spec>` from a configuration file. The
  default is to use the specification inside the command line arguments
  or (alternatively) to read the specification from `stdin`.

The following PEG-style grammar loosly describes the specification `<spec>`.
For exact details see the [real PEG grammar of stmux](src/stmux.pegjs).

```
spec      ::= "[" directive (":"  directive)* "]"  /* vertical   split */
            | "[" directive (".." directive)* "]"  /* horizontal split */

directive ::= spec                                 /* RECURSION */
            | option* string                       /* shell command */

option    ::= ("-f" | "--focus")                   /* focus terminal initially */
            | ("-r" | "--restart")                 /* restart command automatically */
            | ("-d" | "--delay") number            /* delay <number> seconds on restart */
            | ("-t" | "--title") string            /* set title of terminal */
```

The following keystrokes are supported under run-time:

- `CTRL`+*activator* *activator*:<br/>
  Send the `CTRL`+*activator* key-sequence to the focused terminal.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `LEFT`:<br/>
  Switch the focus to the previous terminal in sequence.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `RIGHT`/`SPACE`:<br/>
  Switch the focus to the next terminal in sequence.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `l`:<br/>
  Relayout the screen.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `v`:<br/>
  Switch the focused terminal into visual/scrolling mode.
  Use `PAGEUP`/`PAGEDOWN` during this mode to scroll up/down.
  Any other key leaves this mode.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `k`:<br/>
  Kill the application and all shell commands in all terminals.
