Abstract
--------

This is a simple terminal multiplexing utility for Node.js
environments. It is inspired by the awesome and unreachable
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) native Unix utility. It is intended
to provide a just very tiny subset of the original functionality,
but instead in a portable way for bare Node.js environments. It's
only nasty dependency is the essential native Node.js module
[node-pty](https://github.com/Tyriar/node-pty). As a consequence this
utility can be installed via just NPM and without any surrounding Unix
environments (like CygWin under Windows, etc).

Example
-------

The following command...

```
$ stmux -w -- [ [ bash .. vi ] : mc ]
```

...leads to the following result:

Intention
---------

This utility is primarily intended to be used for within a
`package.json` `script` to side-by-side run various NPM scripts in a
Node.js build-time environment. For more sophisticated use-cases please
stick with [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/), of course.

A sample `package.json` entry would be:

```
{
    ...
    "devDependencies": {
        "stmux": "*"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "dev":      "stmux -- [ [ 'npm run build:ui' .. 'npm run build:sv' ] : [ 'bash' .. 'npm start' ] ]",
        "build:ui": "cd ui && npm build:watch",
        "build:sv": "cd sv && npm build:watch",
        "start":    "cd sv && npm start"
    }
}
```

Installation
------------

```
$ npm install -g stmux
```

Usage
-----

The following command line arguments are supported:

```
$ stmux [-h] [-V] [-w] [-a <activator>] [-t <title>] [-f <file>] [-- <spec>]
```

- `-h`, `--help`<br/>
  Show usage help.
- `-V`, `--version`<br/>
  Show program version information.
- `-w`, `--wait`<br/>
  Wait after last finished command and do not shutdown automatically.
- `-a <activator>`, `--activator <activator>`<br/>
  Use `CTRL+<activator>` as the prefix to special commands.
  The default activator character is `a`.
- `-t <title>`, `--title <title>`<br/>
  Set title on terminal. The default title is `stmux`.
- `-f <file>`, `--file <file>`<br/>
  Read specification from configuration file. The
  default is to use the specification in the command line arguments.

The following grammar describes the specification:

```
spec      ::= "[" directive (":"  directive)* "]"  /* vertical   split */
            | "[" directive (".." directive)* "]"  /* horizontal split */

directive ::= spec                                 /* RECURSION */
            | option* string                       /* shell command */

option    ::= ("-f" | "--focus")                   /* focus terminal initially */
            | ("-r" | "--restart")                 /* restart command automatically */
            | ("-d" | "--delay") number            /* delay <number> seconds on restart */
            | ("-t" | "--title") string            /* set title of terminal */
```

The following run-time keystrokes are supported:

- `CTRL`+*activator* *activator*:<br/>
  Send the `CTRL`+*activator* key-sequence to terminal.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `LEFT`:<br/>
  Switch the focus to the previous terminal.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `RIGHT`/`SPACE`:<br/>
  Switch the focus to the next terminal.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `v`:<br/>
  Switch the focused terminal into visual scrolling mode.
  Use `PAGEUP`/`PAGEDOWN` during this mode. Any other
  key leaves this mode again.
- `CTRL`+*activator* `k`:<br/>
  Kill the program manually.
